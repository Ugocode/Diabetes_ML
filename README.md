Indian Diabetes prediction 

Clustering.

This is the use of unsupervised machine Learning algorithm  in predicting the likelyhood of diabetes in a patient. 

It uses the algorithm of K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for clustering / grouping the people with diabetes and those that do not have it.

This gives us great insights.

Take time and explore the project.
